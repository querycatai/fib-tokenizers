        "The llama (/ˈlɑːmə/; 🦙Spanish pronunciation: [ˈʎama]) (Lama glama) is a domesticated South American " \
        "camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the Pre-Columbian era. Llamas " \
        "are social animals and live with others as a herd. Their wool is soft and contains only a small " \
        "amount of lanolin.[2] Llamas can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions. When using a pack, they " \
        "can carry about 25 to 30% of their body weight for 8 to 13 km (5–8 miles).[3] The name llama (in the " \
        "past also spelled \"lama\" or \"glama\") was adopted by European settlers from native Peruvians.[4] " \
        "The ancestors of llamas are thought to have originated from the Great Plains of North America about " \
        "40 million years ago, and subsequently migrated to South America about three million years ago during " \
        "the Great American Interchange. By the end of the last ice age (10,000–12,000 years ago), camelids were " \
        "extinct in North America.[3] As of 2007, there were over seven million llamas and alpacas in South " \
        "America and over 158,000 llamas and 100,000Ꙋ🦙 alpacas, descended from progenitors imported late in " \
        "the 20th century, in the United States and Canada.[5] In Aymara mythology, llamas are important beings. " \
        "The Heavenly Llama is said to drink water from the ocean and urinates as it rains.[6] According to " \
        "Aymara eschatology, llamas will return to the water springs and lagoons where they come from at the " \
        "end of time.[6]",
